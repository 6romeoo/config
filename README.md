# oauth2-client-shell-v2

Interface for going through the OAuth 2.0 authorization code grant flow as per
[RFC 6749 section 4](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4). Uses local
and session storage to store state. This is a refresh of
[oauth2-client-shell](https://github.com/neverendingqs/oauth2-client-shell).

```sh
# Running it with a self-signed certificate for local use only
npm run serve
```
