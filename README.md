# oauth2-client-shell-v2

Interface for going through the OAuth 2.0 authorization code grant flow. Uses
local and session storage to store state. This is a refresh of
[oauth2-client-shell](https://github.com/neverendingqs/oauth2-client-shell).

```sh
# Running it with a self-signed certificate for local use only
npm run serve
```
